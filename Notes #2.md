# Notes #2
* Epic story contains a bug/feature/change
* Team acts as the control board to process the information
* Epic story is broken down and divided among engineers
* Any changes should be documented
* Each feature that is pushed becomes a branch in a tree-like structure of changes
* The master branch hold each branch and acts as the central point
* Separate branches can be merged into one branch
